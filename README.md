# csci455-UDPServer
## Multithreaded UDP Server/Client
To run this program simply run the UDPServer file to start up the server. Next, run the UDP_Client file to start a new client. UDP_Client can be ran in as many instances as you like. Send messages to the server via the client console. Enter "exit" when ready to quit in that client.
